# Hello, everyone!

## This is a little guide to this repo for co-founders or co-workers idk

Cause i'm junior developer, i need to improve my skills and knowledges everyday. 
So, i create this repo for learn new features in React development. 

I thought there was no shame in showing someone that I didn't know something, on the contrary, I thought it was shameful to stand still and not develop. 

Thanks to this repository, you can look at how I mastered the chips in developing React applications. 

Also, this repository serves as proof of my work for a potential employer. 

Thank you for your time!
